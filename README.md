# Dialogic logic programming VM prototype

It will likely take few more attempts to get this right.
The parallel disjunction rule is difficult to implement.

I used a variation of
[Alan Mycroft's prolog interpreter](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~am21/research/funnel/prolog.c)
as a basis.
Dmiles had made the interpreter more flexible.
I translated that one into Python.
That translated version was my starting point for this interpreter.
There's not much left from the original interpreter though!

At the moment I got to write few demonstrations and maybe minor bugfixes.
